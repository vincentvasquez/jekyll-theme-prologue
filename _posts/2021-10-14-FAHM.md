I got to attend a Filipino American History Month event last night with several people from other tech companies in the Bay Area. It was a great experience to join. 
This event was my introduction to FAHM. My Octobers now have a new reason to celebrate in addition to my mom's and my birthdays!

I'd like to share a <a href="https://spark.adobe.com/page/LEDgv7QPa4coe/">website</a> that was created by some folks at Adobe
