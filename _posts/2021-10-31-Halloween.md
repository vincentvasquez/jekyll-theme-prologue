Happy Halloween!
I'm not going trick or treating, or even dressing up this year; but if you're celebrating I hope you do so safely.

Today I got around to linking my github page to my custom domain, and its working!
I was able to get GitHub desktop linked to IDE, so that I could write these blog posts all from Atom!
